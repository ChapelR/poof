# POOF

A Twine 2 proofing format. In a prerelease state, currently.

Features:
    * Simple and readable, but more manageable than Paperthin.
    * Review you stylesheet and JavaScript code in addition to your passages.
    * Export your source code to PDF, plain text (in twee notation), html, or (planned) RTF.
    * Sortable, filterable, and searchable passage list (planned).

## Install

For now, the only way to install is to grab the `format.js` file (in `dist/format`) and let your compiler know about it. A hosted release and zip release will be coming someday.
